« UNIFIED PERFORMANCE + CAUSATION + AD-LEVEL DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM SPEC
(All components integrated into one coherent model)

Your scoring model measures WHAT is happening, not why.
It uses absolute thresholds and trend thresholds, with false-positive protections.

Scoring distributes:

A) Engagement Quality — 45 pts
+ Dwell Time (20 pts)
+ CTR (15 pts)
+ Frequency (10 pts)

B) Cost Efficiency — 35 pts
+ CPC (20 pts)
+ CPM (10 pts)
+ CPA (5 pts, only if ≥3 conversions)

C) Audience Quality — 20 pts
+ Penetration (10 pts)
+ Seniority (10 pts)

~ 1.1 Updated Dwell Time Scoring — 20 pts

Absolute Quality (12 pts)
Dwell Time | Score
≥15.0s | 12
13.0-14.9s | 10
≥1.00% | 10
0.70-0.99% | 8
0.50-0.69% | 6
0.40-0.49% | 4
0.30-0.39% | 2
<0.30% | 0

Trend (5 pts)
Requires ≥2,500 impressions and ≥4/7 days active.
Change | Score
≥+20% | 5
+10-19% | 4
0-9% | 4
-1 to -10% | 2
-11-20% | 0
<-20% | -1

~ 1.3 Frequency Scoring — 10 pts (updated)
Frequency | Score
2.0-4.0 | 10
1.5-1.99 | 7
<1.5 | 3 (underexposed)
4.1-6.0 | 4 (high exposure)
>6.0 | 2 (fatigue emerging)
>7.0 | 0 (likely fatigue)

~ 1.4 Audience Penetration Scoring — 10 pts
Penetration | Score
10-30% | 10
31-45% | 7
46-60% | 4
>60% | 1 (likely fatigue)
<10% | 2 (under-delivery)

~ 1.5 Seniority Scoring — 10 pts
Seniority shift toward decision-makers | Score
+10% or more | 10
+5-9% | 7
Stable | 5
Shift downward | 0

The system refuses to score trends unless ALL are true:
✓ Campaign active ≥4 of last 7 days
✓ Minimum volumes hit:
  + ≥2,500 impressions (CTR trends)
  + ≥20 clicks (dwell/CPC trends)
  + ≥1,000 impressions for frequency/penetration
  + ≥3 conversions for CPA
  + ≥1,000 impressions for seniority shift
✓ Ad must run ≥3 days to evaluate
✓ Recent changes must be ≥48 hours old
✓ No scoring on paused/no-delivery campaigns

This prevents zombie trends, false signals, and noise.

This explains WHY the score changed.
It analyzes 3 layers:
① Layer 1 — Creative (Ad Level)
② Layer 2 — Bidding (Auction)
③ Layer 3 — Targeting (Audience)

~ 3.1 Creative Causation Rules (Ad-Level Insights Used at Campaign Level)

Ad Age (Updated)
Ad Age | Label
0-13 days | Learning
14-59 days | Stable
≥60 days | Potential fatigue

Creative Fatigue Indicators
+ Age ≥60 days
+ CTR↓ & Dwell↓
+ Impression share >70%
→ Primary cause: Creative Fatigue

Too Few Ads (<3 active)
→ LinkedIn serves 1 ad per user per day
→ Causes: under-exposure, CTR↓, delivery↓

New creative impact
If new ads (<13 days) show higher dwell/CTR → uplift
If lower → not responsible for improvement

~ 3.2 Bidding Causation Rules

Suggested Bid Movement
The MOST important external signal.

Change | Meaning
↑ >20% | Auction pressure ↑ (competitors bidding more)
↑ 10-20% | Moderate pressure
↓ >10% | Cheaper auction
↓ >20% | Major drop in demand

Effects:
+ CPM↑ with suggested bid↑ → auction inflation
+ CTR↓ with suggested bid↑ → worse placements
+ CPC↑ with stable CTR → cost inflation

Manual Bid Changed
+ Bid↑ → CTR↓, delivery↑
+ Bid↓ → CTR↑, delivery↓

Bidding Strategy Changes
+ Manual → Max Delivery → CPM↑, CPC↓
+ Max Delivery → Manual → risk of volatility

~ 3.3 Targeting Causation Rules

Audience Size Change
Shrank >20% → CPM↑, CTR↓
Expanded → CPM↓, CTR more volatile

Penetration >60%
→ Audience exhaustion → CTR↓ likely

Seniority Shift
+10% seniors → CTR↓, dwell↑, CPC↑
- seniority → CTR↑, dwell↓

Audience Expansion ON
→ Lower intent users → CTR↓, CPC↓

When a user clicks a campaign (especially a "bad" one):
The right panel loads the AD DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM.

This shows which ads are driving performance, NOT ad-level scores.

~ 4.1 Ad Snapshot Card (per ad)

Each ad card displays:
+ Thumbnail
+ Impressions
+ CTR vs campaign avg
+ Dwell vs campaign avg
+ CPC vs avg
+ CPM vs avg
+ Ad Age bucket (your new rules)
+ Impression share
+ Diagnostic flags

~ 4.2 Ad Diagnostic Flags (Auto-assigned)

Green: High Contributor
+ CTR↑ & dwell↑
+ Ad age 14-59
+ Lower CPC

Grey: Stable Contributor
+ Within ±10% of campaign averages

Red: Weak Contributor
+ CTR↓ ≥15%
+ Dwell↓ ≥10%
+ Old age (≥60 days)
+ Impression share >70%

Yellow: Learning Phase
+ Age <13 days
+ Performance unstable

Blue: Low Volume
+ Impressions <1,000
+ "Cannot evaluate"

Purple: Fatigue
+ Age ≥60 days
+ Dwell↓ & CTR↓

~ 4.3 Ad-Level Causation Examples

If CTR↓ but dwell↑
→ "Deep B2B content consumption, not click decline."

If CTR↑ but dwell↓
→ "Curiosity clicks — content not resonating post-click."

If impression share >70%
→ "Algorithm over-serving this ad; likely causing fatigue."

If only 1-2 ads active
→ "Campaign delivery throttled — add more ads."

~ 4.4 Ad Contributor Ranking (Green / Grey / Red)

Tiered sorting:
+ Tier 1: High Contributors
+ Tier 2: Neutral
+ Tier 3: Weak Contributors

This helps answer:
"Which ads are dragging down my campaign?"

~ 4.5 Recommended Actions (Ad-Level)

Examples:
+ "Pause Ad A — pulling down campaign (−32% CTR, -18% dwell)."
+ "Ad B is strong (+27% dwell) — create a variant."
+ "Ad overload: 80% impressions to one creative → refresh needed."
+ "Only 1 active ad — add 2-3 creatives."

STEP 1 — User clicks a campaign
Campaign summary loads with score.

STEP 2 — False-Positive Checks
If data insufficient → show "Low confidence / incomplete data."

STEP 3 — Score campaign
(Using updated rules)

STEP 4 — Show primary causes
From 3 layers (creative, bidding, targeting)

STEP 5 — Load Ad-Level Diagnostics Panel
+ Rank ads
+ Apply diagnostic flags
+ Highlight weak contributors
+ Highlight strong contributors

STEP 6 — Combine all signals into final narrative

Example output:

Primary Cause: Audience fatigue (penetration 63%, frequency 7.2)
Secondary: Suggested bid increased +22% → higher CPM and worse placements
Ad-level: Ad 3 responsible for 74% impressions and is 67 days old → fatigue
Recommendation: Refresh creatives, add 2-3 variants, expand audience, raise bid 10%

✓ Scoring model
✓ Causation engine
✓ Ad-level drilldown
✓ Updated thresholds
✓ B2B behavioural logic
✓ Fatigue logic
✓ Auction-pressure logic
✓ Targeting-shift logic
