⭐ ACCOUNT HISTORY & CHANGE TRACKING LAYER (FULL SPEC)

This layer makes your system much smarter than LinkedIn’s native UI.

⸻

================================

⭐ 1. WHAT DATA YOU MUST STORE DAILY

================================

Every 24 hours, snapshot and store:

⸻

🟦 1.1 Campaign Settings
	•	Campaign name
	•	Campaign status (active/paused)
	•	Bid value
	•	Bid strategy
	•	Daily/Lifetime budget
	•	Audience expansion status
	•	Objective
	•	Optimisation goal (clicks, impressions, leads)
	•	Suggested bid (VERY important)
	•	LinkedIn relevance diagnostics (if available)

⸻

🟧 1.2 Targeting Parameters

Store every dimension:
	•	Locations
	•	Job titles
	•	Job seniority
	•	Job functions
	•	Skills
	•	Industries
	•	Company list inclusions
	•	Exclusions
	•	Audience size estimate
	•	Matched audience lists
	•	Lookalike settings

⸻

🟩 1.3 Ads (Creatives)

Track:
	•	Ads active
	•	Ads paused
	•	Ad age (derived)
	•	Creative format
	•	Body text / headline
	•	Image checksum or hash (to detect creative changes)
	•	Impression share per ad
	•	Ad introduction date
	•	Ad pause date

⸻

🟨 1.4 Delivery & Cost Data
	•	Daily impressions
	•	Daily clicks
	•	Daily CPC
	•	Daily CPM
	•	Daily spend
	•	Daily frequency
	•	Daily penetration
	•	Daily seniority distribution (LinkedIn demographics)

⸻

================================

⭐ 2. WHAT YOU MUST VERSION

================================

When any value changes, store:
	•	Previous version
	•	New version
	•	Timestamp

Examples:

If bid changes from 8.00 → 6.50

Store both values + timestamp.

If job titles change (added or removed)

Store the diff.

If target audience size drops from 600k → 300k

Store both & diff.

If a creative is paused

Store pause event.

This enables before vs after causation.

⸻

================================

⭐ 3. CHANGE AGE REQUIREMENTS (How long until data is usable?)

================================

These rules prevent misleading conclusions from fresh changes.

⸻

3.1 Targeting Changes

Require: ≥72 hours before judging performance impact.

Reason: LinkedIn needs time to rebalance delivery.

⸻

3.2 Bidding Changes

Require: ≥48 hours before evaluating impact.

Auction stabilises within ~2 days.

⸻

3.3 Creative (Ad) Changes

Require:
	•	≥72 hours for new ads
	•	≥48 hours after pausing ads
	•	≥14 days for fatigue detection

⸻

3.4 Audience Size Collapse / Expansion

Require: ≥72 hours because LinkedIn refreshes inventory slowly.

⸻

3.5 Suggested Bid Shifts

These take effect immediately, but causation confidence increases when the new bid remains shifted ≥48 hours.

⸻

================================

⭐ 4. HOW THE CAUSATION ENGINE USES CHANGE HISTORY

================================

When performance changes (CTR, Dwell, CPC, CPM), the engine checks:

⸻

⭐ 4.1 Did any change occur in the last 48–72 hours?

If yes:

Causation output includes:
	•	“Recent targeting change detected — impact may not yet be stable.”
	•	“Bid was adjusted 2 days ago — evaluating post-change effects.”
	•	“New creatives introduced — early signals only.”

And it lowers “causation confidence” to Medium instead of High.

⸻

⭐ 4.2 Did any change occur 4–14 days ago?

This is the optimal window for attribution.

Example:

CTR dropped –22%
👉 Bid lowered 6 days ago → primary cause
👉 Penetration 62% → secondary cause

⸻

⭐ 4.3 Did no settings change?

Then the cause is usually:
	•	Creative fatigue
	•	Auction pressure (suggested bid↑)
	•	Audience composition shift
	•	Penetration / frequency-driven fatigue

⸻

================================

⭐ 5. HOW THE SYSTEM AVOIDS FALSE POSITIVES USING HISTORY

================================

The system does NOT blame:
	•	New ads (<3 days old)
	•	Fresh targeting changes (<3 days old)
	•	Fresh bid changes (<2 days old)
	•	Low-volume days
	•	Partial-week running

Examples of rules:

If CTR ↓ but targeting changed 48 hours ago →

Do NOT assign CTR decline to creative fatigue.

If suggested bid↑ but bid change occurred in last 24 hours →

Don’t assume auction pressure is the primary cause until 48 hours pass.

If ad paused 2 days ago →

Don’t assume performance shift is due to remaining ads yet.

⸻

================================

⭐ 6. INTEGRATION INTO THE UNIFIED SYSTEM

================================

Now I combine this with the previous unified spec to form a complete architecture.

(This turns your system into a professional-grade diagnostic engine.)

⸻

⭐ UPDATED UNIFIED SYSTEM — WITH FULL CHANGE HISTORY LAYER

Below is the combined, final structure:

⸻

⭐ PART 1 — Campaign Scoring (WHAT is happening)

Uses updated dwell/CTR/frequency scoring + false-positive filters.

⸻

⭐ PART 2 — Causation Engine (WHY it’s happening)

Now upgraded with change-history logic:

For every performance shift:
	•	Check creative state (age, fatigue, distribution)
	•	Check bidding state (auction pressure, bid changes)
	•	Check targeting state (audience shifts, seniority)
	•	Check change history
	•	If changes are too fresh → neutralise causation
	•	If changes are older & correlated → causation confirmed

⸻

⭐ PART 3 — Ad-Level Diagnostics Panel (which ads are responsible)

Now upgraded to:
	•	Detect creative churn
	•	Detect when ads were added/paused
	•	Track impression shifts after settings changes
	•	Compare performance pre-change vs post-change
	•	Flag weak contributors using new dwell/CTR thresholds

⸻

⭐ PART 4 — System-wide False Positive Suppression

Now includes:

Must have:

✔ Minimum impression/click volume
✔ Campaign live ≥4 of last 7 days
✔ Changes older than 48–72 hours
✔ Ad with ≥1,000 impressions to evaluate

Prevents:
	•	Misidentifying causes
	•	Penalising new ads
	•	Wrongly attributing fresh targeting changes
	•	Mistaking bid volatility for performance movement

⸻

⭐ PART 5 — Final Explanation Output

Now includes:

“Change Event Narrative”

Example:

Primary Cause: CTR decreased 27% due to targeting narrowed 6 days ago (audience size –38%).
Secondary Cause: Audience penetration now 58% → fatigue emerging.
Excluded Causes: Recent bid increase (<48 hours old) not included yet.
Ad-Level: Ad 4 responsible for 72% impressions and is 65 days old — likely exacerbating decline.
Confidence: High (all changes older than 72 hours).
